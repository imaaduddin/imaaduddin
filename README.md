# Hi, I'm Imaad ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in **New York City** with 3 years of experience building modern, user-centric web applications.

I have a deep interest in **front-end engineering and design**. I love crafting sleek, visually appealing user interfaces that donâ€™t just look goodâ€”but work beautifully. In my free time, I dive into projects built with **React** and **Next.js**, constantly exploring the latest in UI/UX, design systems, and frontend tech.

I'm also passionate about the **transformative power of AI and machine learning**. Lately, Iâ€™ve been focused on projects that bridge the gap between software engineering and intelligent systemsâ€”learning, building, and experimenting with the possibilities of LLMs, deep learning, and real-world AI applications.
